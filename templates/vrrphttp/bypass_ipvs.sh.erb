# Invoked by keepalived from master/slave
# to slave/master transition to add or remove
# a PREROUTING rule
#
# Essential for slave to redirect incoming 
# service packet to localhost. Otherwise a
# loop can appear between master and slave.
# 
# The routing table is consulted when a packet
# that creates a new connection is encountered.
# PREROUTING rule alters packets as soon as they come in.
# REDIRECT statement redirects the packet to the machine
# itself by changing the destination IP to the primary
# address of the incoming interface (locally-generated
# packets are mapped to the 127.0.0.1 address).

# Check number of command line args
