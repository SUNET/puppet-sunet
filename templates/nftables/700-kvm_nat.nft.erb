# When running KVM via libvirt the "default" network is configured with
# <forward mode='nat'/>. This means libvirt will create iptables rules built
# into its code at startup. Since these changes are only supplied to the
# "iptables" command, and not persisted in any files, a later "systemctl reload
# nftables" will make those rules disappear, resulting in broken networking for
# KVM guests using the default virbr0 bridge for connectivity.
#
# This nft script mimics the NAT rules created by libvirt, here is how the
# NAT-specific rules look after starting libvirt (created by iptables which is
# automatically translating them to nftables rules behind the scenes):
# ===
# table ip nat {
#        chain LIBVIRT_PRT {
#                ip saddr 192.168.122.0/24 ip daddr 224.0.0.0/24 counter packets 0 bytes 0 return
#                ip saddr 192.168.122.0/24 ip daddr 255.255.255.255 counter packets 0 bytes 0 return

# There are some more rules created by libvirt related to filtering, but lets
# start with only the masquerading and see if anything else needs adding later.
#
# The specific network used (192.168.122.0/24) is based on the network
# assigned to the "default" network, which can be seen with:
# "virsh net-dumpxml default --inactive"
#
# A final difference is that we use the "inet" family instead of ip + ip6. Our
# other rules are all using the inet family (which allows both ip4 and ip6
# rules) so lets keep it that way.
