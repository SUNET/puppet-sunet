# This script is used to enable authentication and set up permissions for the
# knubbis-fleetlock service in etcd.

# When running this for the first time the authentication will not be
# enabled in etcd and that will lead to errors in the logs like "etcdserver:
# authentication is not enabled" when running commands. The actions will still
# be carried out anyway so it seems easier to just always include
# username/password than trying to figure out if auth is enabled.

# Prefer env variable over passing the password on the command line (since that
# would make it visible in the process list).
