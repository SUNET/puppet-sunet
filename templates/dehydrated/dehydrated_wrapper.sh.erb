# This wrapper is a bit silly but it might be the best way to be SURE that one broken domain doesn't
# mess up ALL configured domains. It will also, through scriptherder, hopefully highlight problems
# with domains that are either misconfigured or have any other kind of issues.
#
# This is sadly dependent upon /etc/dehydrated/config2 to work. DOMAINS_TXT variable could not be set
# outside of the configfile and I didn't want to break backwards comp by fiddling with domains.txt.
#
# Scriptherder was not meant to be run dynamically, must cheat to create check/ini-files...
