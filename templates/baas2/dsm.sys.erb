*  COMMMETHOD         V6TCPIP
*  legacy clients may have to use TCPIP
*
*  patlu: While mentioned as a "legacy" option, if we use V6TCPIP this causes
*  the "dsmcad" process to use around 50% of a CPU core constantly. This odd
*  behaviour seems to be triggered because the process looks up the name of the
*  machine it runs on at startup, and unlike IPv4 that has a matching entry in
*  /etc/hosts, this does not exist for IPv6 which causes a DNS lookup to the
*  local systemd-resolved  which in turn gives back an empty NOERROR response.
*  We can solve this either by using "TCPIP", or we can add a "::1" entry for
*  the hostname in /etc/hosts like it exists for 127.0.0.1. Using TCPIP just
*  felt like the less intrusive option for now.
